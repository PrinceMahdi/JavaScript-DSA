# Set:

- Unordered list of data
- Duplicates arenâ€™t allowed
- Insertion order is NOT memorized or stored
- You get access to elements through a method
- They are iterable which means you loop through it
- The length is adjusted dynamically
- Deletion and finding elements are fast

# Set vs Array:

- Use arrays if the order matters and if you want duplicates
- Use sets if you delete and look for values quite often and if you want a list of unique values
