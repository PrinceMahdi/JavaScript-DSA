# Arrays:
- Ordered list of data
- Duplicates are allowed
- Insertion order is memorized and elements can be accesssed through an index
- They’re iterable which means you can loop through it
- They’re dynamic which means the length adjusts dynamically in JavaScript
- You can have an array of mixed types (strings, numbers, etc)
