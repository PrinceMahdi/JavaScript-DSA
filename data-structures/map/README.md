# Map:

- Ordered key-value pairs of data
- Elements can be accessed through a key
- You can loop through them
- Keys are unique, values aren't
- Keys can be anything. They can be reference values like arrays
- They're pure data storages unlike objects

# Maps vs Objects:

- Maps are focused on data storage
- Maps simplify and improve data access compared to objects
- Objects are versatile and easy to use
- Objects are used when you want more functionality
